Explanation of the Flow
Start App (index.js):

The React application starts, and the index.js file renders the App component.
The Provider component from react-redux is used to wrap the App component, making the Redux store available to the entire application.
Render App Component (App.js):

The App component is rendered, which includes the User component with the userId prop.
Render User Component (User.js):

The User component is rendered.
The useEffect hook is used to dispatch the fetchUser action when the component mounts.
Dispatch fetchUser Action:

The fetchUser action is dispatched, which triggers the fetchUser thunk.
User Slice (userSlice.js):

The userSlice defines the initial state and reducers for handling user data.
The extraReducers in the slice handle the different states (pending, fulfilled, rejected) of the fetchUser async action.
Define AsyncThunk fetchUser:

The fetchUser async action makes an API call to fetch user data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{userId}.
Make API Call:

The API call is made, and the response is handled in the extraReducers.
Update State with User Data or Error:

Based on the result of the API call, the state is updated:
pending: The state is set to loading.
fulfilled: The state is updated with the fetched user data.
rejected: The state is updated with the error message.
Render User Component Based on State:

The User component re-renders based on the updated state:
loading: Displays "Loading...".
succeeded: Displays the user's name and email.
failed: Displays the error message.
This flowchart and explanation should help you understand how the different parts of the application interact and how the data flows from the user action to the final rendered output.
